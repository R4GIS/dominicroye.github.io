In addition, I would like to take advantage of the blog and publish short introductions and explanation on data visualization, management and manipulation in R. I hope you like it. Any suggestion or ideas are welcomed.\nBackground\rI have always wanted to write about the use of the pie chart. The pie chart is widely used in research, teaching, journalism or technical reports. I do not know if it is due to Excel, but even worse than the pie chart itself, is its 3D version (the same for the bar chart). About the 3D versions, I only want to say that they are not recommended, since in these cases the third dimension does not contain any information and therefore it does not help to correctly read the information of the graphic. Regarding the pie chart, among many experts its use is not advised. But why?\nAlready in a study conducted by Simkin and Hastie (1987) they found that the interpretation and processing of angles is more difficult than that of linear forms. Mostly it is easier to read a bar chart than a pie chart. A problem that becomes very visible when we have; 1) too many categories 2) few differences between categories 3) a misuse of colors as legend or 4) comparisons between various pie charts.\nIn general, to decide what possible graphic representations exist for our data, I recommend using the website www.data-to-viz.com or the Financial Times Visual Vocabulary.\n\nWell, now what alternative ways can we use in R?\n\rAlternatives to the pie chart\rThe dataset we will use about the vaccination status of measles correspond to June 2018 in Europe and come from the ECDC.\n#packages\rlibrary(tidyverse)\rlibrary(scales)\rlibrary(RColorBrewer)\r#data\rmeasles \u0026lt;- data.frame(\rvacc_status=c(\u0026quot;Unvaccinated\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;1 Dose\u0026quot;,\r\u0026quot;\u0026gt;= 2 Dose\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Unkown Dose\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Unkown\u0026quot;),\rprop=c(0.75,0.091,0.05,0.012,0.096)\r)\r#we order from the highest to the lowest and fix it with a factor\rmeasles \u0026lt;- arrange(measles,\rdesc(prop))%\u0026gt;%\rmutate(vacc_status=factor(vacc_status,vacc_status))\r\r\rvacc_status\rprop\r\r\r\rUnvaccinated\r0.750\r\rUnkown\r0.096\r\r1 Dose\r0.091\r\r\u0026gt;= 2 Dose\r0.050\r\rUnkown Dose\r0.012\r\r\r\rBar plot or similar\rggplot(measles,aes(vacc_status,prop))+\rgeom_bar(stat=\u0026quot;identity\u0026quot;)+\rscale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,1,.1),\rlabels=percent, #convert to %\rlimits=c(0,1))+\rlabs(x=\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,y=\u0026quot;\u0026quot;)+\rtheme_minimal()\rggplot(measles,aes(x=vacc_status,prop,ymin=0,ymax=prop))+\rgeom_pointrange()+\rscale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,1,.1),\rlabels=percent, #convert to %\rlimits=c(0,1))+\rlabs(x=\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,y=\u0026quot;\u0026quot;)+\rtheme_minimal()\r#custom themes definitions\rtheme_singlebar \u0026lt;- theme_bw()+\rtheme(\rlegend.position = \u0026quot;bottom\u0026quot;,\raxis.title = element_blank(),\raxis.ticks.y = element_blank(),\raxis.text.y = element_blank(),\rpanel.border = element_blank(),\rpanel.grid=element_blank(),\rplot.title=element_text(size=14, face=\u0026quot;bold\u0026quot;)\r)\r#plot\rmutate(measles,\rvacc_status=factor(vacc_status, #we change the order of the categories\rrev(levels(vacc_status))))%\u0026gt;%\rggplot(aes(1,prop,fill=vacc_status))+ #we put 1 in x to create a single bar\rgeom_bar(stat=\u0026quot;identity\u0026quot;)+\rscale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,1,.1),\rlabels=percent,\rlimits=c(0,1),\rexpand=c(.01,.01))+\rscale_x_continuous(expand=c(0,0))+\rscale_fill_brewer(\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,palette=\u0026quot;Set1\u0026quot;)+\rcoord_flip()+\rtheme_singlebar\r#we expand our data with numbers from Italy\rmeasles2 \u0026lt;- mutate(measles,\ritaly=c(0.826,0.081,0.053,0.013,0.027),\rvacc_status=factor(vacc_status,rev(levels(vacc_status))))%\u0026gt;%\rrename(europe=\u0026quot;prop\u0026quot;)%\u0026gt;%\rgather(region,prop,europe:italy)\r#plot\rggplot(measles2,aes(region,prop,fill=vacc_status))+\rgeom_bar(stat=\u0026quot;identity\u0026quot;,position=\u0026quot;stack\u0026quot;)+ #stack bar\rscale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,1,.1),\rlabels=percent, #convert to %\rlimits=c(0,1),\rexpand=c(0,0))+\rscale_fill_brewer(palette = \u0026quot;Set1\u0026quot;)+\rlabs(x=\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,y=\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,fill=\u0026quot;Vaccination Status\u0026quot;)+\rtheme_minimal()\r\rWaffle plot\r#package\rlibrary(waffle)\r#the waffle function uses a vector with names\rval_measles \u0026lt;- round(measles$prop*100)\rnames(val_measles) \u0026lt;- measles$vacc_status\r#plot\rwaffle(val_measles, #data\rcolors=brewer.pal(5,\u0026quot;Set1\u0026quot;), #colors\rrows=5) #row number \rThe Waffle chart seems very interesting to me when we want to show a proportion of an individual category.\n#data\rmedida \u0026lt;- c(41,59) #data from the OECD 2015\rnames(medida) \u0026lt;- c(\u0026quot;Estudios Superiores\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Otros estudios\u0026quot;)\r#plot\rwaffle(medida,\rcolors=c(\u0026quot;#377eb8\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;#bdbdbd\u0026quot;),\rrows=5)\r\rTreemap\r#package\rlibrary(treemap)\r#plot\rtreemap(measles,\rindex=\u0026quot;vacc_status\u0026quot;, #variable with categories\rvSize=\u0026quot;prop\u0026quot;, #values\rtype=\u0026quot;index\u0026quot;, #style more in ?treemap\rtitle=\u0026quot;\u0026quot;, palette = brewer.pal(5,\u0026quot;Set1\u0026quot;) #colors\r)\rPersonally, I think that all types of graphic representations have their advantages and disadvantages. However, we currently have a huge variety of alternatives to avoid using the pie chart. If you still want to make a pie chart, which I would not rule out either, I recommend following certain rules, which you can find very well summarized in a recent post by Lisa Charlotte Rost. For example, you should order from the highest to the lowest unless there is a natural order or use a maximum of five categories. Finally, I leave you a link to a cheat sheet from policyviz with basic rules of data visualization. A good reference on graphics using different programs from Excel to R can be found in the book Creating More Effective Graphs (Robbins 2013).\n\rReferences\rRobbins, Naomi B. 2013.

The South and East interior parts of Puerto Rico are characterized by higher CI and the West and North-West parts show lower CI. The annual CI and the rainy season CI show a gradient from South-East to North-West and the dry season CI shows a gradient from South to North. Another difference between the rainy season CI and dry season CI is that the former shows the lowest values of CI while the latter shows the highest values of CI. The different types of seasonal precipitation seem to play a major role on the spatial CI distribution. However, the local relief plays a major role in the spatial patterns due to the effect of the air circulation by the mountains.

The role of the environment on cardiovascular health is becoming more prominent in the context of global change. The aim of this study was to analyze the relationship between apparent temperature (AT) and air pollutants and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and to study the temporal pattern of this disease and its associated mortality. Methods. We performed a time-series study of admissions for AMI in Cantabria between 2001 and 2015. The association between environmental variables (including a biometeorological index, apparent AT) and AMI was analyzed using a quasi-Poisson regression model. To assess potential delayed and non-linear effects of these variables on AMI, a lag non-linear model was fitted in a generalized additive model. Results. The incidence rate and the mortality followed a downward trend during the study period (CC=–0.714; P=.0002). An annual pattern was found in hospital admissions (P=.005), with the highest values being registered in winter; a weekly trend was also identified, reaching a minimum during the weekends (P=.000005). There was an inverse association between AT and the number of hospital admissions due to AMI and a direct association with particulate matter with a diameter smaller than 10 μm. Conclusions. Hospital admissions for AMI followed a downward trend between 2007 and 2015. Mortality associated with admissions due to this diagnosis has decreased. Predictive factors for this disease were AT and particulate matter with a diameter smaller than 10 μm.","tags":["Acute myocardial infarction","Apparent temperature","Air pollutants","Particulate matter"],"title":"Role of Apparent Temperature and Air Pollutants in Hospital Admissions for Acute Myocardial Infarction in the North of Spain","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D Royé","A Figueiras","M Taracido-Trunk"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1522540800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1522540800,"objectID":"8c48be3d65e4bed0ce4fe5203eb06bb0","permalink":"/en/publication/pharma_coru%C3%B1a_2018/","publishdate":"2018-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/pharma_coru%C3%B1a_2018/","section":"publication","summary":"The consumption of medication, especially over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, can reflect environmental exposure with a lesser degree of severity in terms of morbidity.

In particular, low apparent temperatures proved to be associated with increased sales of respiratory drugs. The strongest consistent risk estimates were found for minimum apparent temperatures in respiratory drug sales with an increase of 33.4% (95% CI: 12.5-58.0%) when the temperature changed from 2.8 ºC to −1.4 ºC. These findings may serve to guide the planning of public health interventions in order to predict and manage the health effects of exposure to the thermal environment for lower degrees of morbidity.

The analysis conducted employed three main methods: the circulation weather types developed by Jenkinson \u0026 Collison, the fit of a generalized additive model for geographic variables and the use of a concentration index for the ratio of lightning strikes and thunderstorm days. The main activity in the summer months can be attributed to situations with eastern or anticyclonic flow due to convection by insolation. In winter, lightning proves to have a frontal origin and is mainly associated with western or cyclonic flow situations which occur with advections of air masses of maritime origin. The largest number of CG discharges occurs under eastern flow and their hybrids with anticyclonic situations. Thunderstorms with greater CG lightning activity, highlighted by a higher Concentration Index, are located in areas with a higher density of lightning strikes, above all in mountainous areas away from the sea. The modeling of lightning density with geographic variables shows the positive influence of altitude and, particularly, distance to the sea, with nonlinear relationships due to the complex orography of the region. Likewise, areas with convex topography receive more lightning strikes than concave ones, a relation which has been demonstrated for the first time from a Generalized Additive Model (GAM).","tags":["thunderstorm","Iberian Peninsula","Concentration Index","weather types","Convexity Index","Generalized Additive Model","cloud-to-ground lightning"],"title":"Spatial–temporal patterns of cloud-to-ground lightning over the northwest Iberian Peninsula during the period 2010–2015","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S Mathbout","JA Lopez-Bustins","D Royé","J Martin-Vide","J Bech","FS Rodrigo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1509494400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1509494400,"objectID":"832515af53727ef93d76e569e64aef88","permalink":"/en/publication/appliedgeophysics_2017_en/","publishdate":"2017-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/appliedgeophysics_2017_en/","section":"publication","summary":"The Eastern Mediterranean is one of the most prominent hot spots of climate change in the world and extreme climatic phenomena in this region such as drought or extreme rainfall events are expected to become more frequent and intense.

Nevertheless, the main focus is usually on the former with the minimum temperature being limited in use as far as human health effects are concerned. Therefore, new thermal indices were used in this research to describe the duration of night hours with air temperatures higher than the 95% percentile of the minimum temperature (Hot Night hours) and intensity as the summation of these air temperatures in degrees (Hot Night degrees). An exposure-response relationship between mortality due to natural, respiratory and cardiovascular causes and summer night temperatures was assessed using data from the Barcelona region between 2003 and 2013. The non-linear relationship between the exposure and response variables was modeled using a distributed lag non-linear model. The estimated associations for both exposure variables and mortality shows a relationship with high and medium values that persist significantly up to a lag of 1–2 days. In mortality due to natural causes an increase of 1.1% per 10% (CI95% 0.6–1.5) for Hot Night hours and 5.8% per each 10º (CI95% 3.5–8.2%) for Hot Night degrees is observed. The effects of Hot Night hours reach their maximum with 100% and leads to an increase by 9.2% (CI95% 5.3–13.1%).

The main result obtained was that weather types giving rise to an increase in admissions due to these diseases are those associated with cold, dry weather, such as those in the east and south-east, or anticyclonic types.

A widespread format is netCDF allowing a multidimensional structure and an exchange of data machine independently. In this article, we introduce the use of these databases with the free software environment R. To do this, we will work with a grid of the maximum temperature of the Iberian Peninsula for the period 1971-2007. The goal is to read and visualize the netCDF format, and make some fist overall and specifi calculations. Finally the applicability is shown in a case study: the diurnal temperature variation in the Iberian Peninsula for January and August 2006.
