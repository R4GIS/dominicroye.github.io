      <description>The distance to the sea is a fundamental variable in geography, especially relevant when it comes to modeling. For example, in interpolations of air temperature, the distance to the sea is usually used as a predictor variable, since there is a casual relationship between the two that explains the spatial variation. How can we estimate the (shortest) distance to the coast in R?
PackagesIn this post we will use the following libraries:</description>

      <title>How to create &#39;Warming Stripes&#39; in R</title>

      <description>This year, the so-called warming stripes, which were created by the scientist Ed Hawkins of the University of Reading, became very famous all over the world. These graphs represent and communicate climate change in a very illustrative and effective way.

&amp;mdash; Ed Hawkins (@ed_hawkins) May 23, 2018  From his idea, I created strips for examples of Spain, like the next one in Madrid.</description>

      <description>The database of Open Street MapsRecently I created a map of the distribution of gas stations and electric charging stations in Europe.

&amp;mdash; Dominic Royé (@dr_xeo) February 25, 2018  How can you obtain this data?
Well, in this case I used points of interest (POIs) from the database of Open Street Maps (OSM).</description>

      <description>Welcome to my blog! I am Dominic Royé, researcher and lecturer of physical geography at the University of Santiago de Compostela. One of my passions is R programming to visualize and analyze any type of data. Hence, my idea of this blog has its origin in my datavis publications I have been cooking in the last year on Twitter on different topics describing the world. In addition, I would like to take advantage of the blog and publish short introductions and explanation on data visualization, management and manipulation in R.</description>
