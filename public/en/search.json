The South and East interior parts of Puerto Rico are characterized by higher CI and the West and North-West parts show lower CI. The annual CI and the rainy season CI show a gradient from South-East to North-West and the dry season CI shows a gradient from South to North. Another difference between the rainy season CI and dry season CI is that the former shows the lowest values of CI while the latter shows the highest values of CI. The different types of seasonal precipitation seem to play a major role on the spatial CI distribution. However, the local relief plays a major role in the spatial patterns due to the effect of the air circulation by the mountains. These findings can contribute to basin-scale water resource management (ooding, soil erosion, etc.) and conservation of the ecological environment.","tags":["Concentration Index","Puerto Rico","precipitation","spatial–temporal patterns"],"title":"Spatial Analysis of Daily Precipitation Concentration in Puerto Rico","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D Royé","MT Zarrabeitia","P Fdez-Arroyabe","A Álvarez-Gutiérrez","A Santurtún"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1525132800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1525132800,"objectID":"9386a67b5c062730063f0a60839e8ab3","permalink":"/en/publication/iam_cantabria_2018/","publishdate":"2018-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/iam_cantabria_2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Introduction and objectives. The role of the environment on cardiovascular health is becoming more prominent in the context of global change. The aim of this study was to analyze the relationship between apparent temperature (AT) and air pollutants and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and to study the temporal pattern of this disease and its associated mortality. Methods. We performed a time-series study of admissions for AMI in Cantabria between 2001 and 2015. The association between environmental variables (including a biometeorological index, apparent AT) and AMI was analyzed using a quasi-Poisson regression model. To assess potential delayed and non-linear effects of these variables on AMI, a lag non-linear model was fitted in a generalized additive model. Results. The incidence rate and the mortality followed a downward trend during the study period (CC=–0.714; P=.0002). An annual pattern was found in hospital admissions (P=.005), with the highest values being registered in winter; a weekly trend was also identified, reaching a minimum during the weekends (P=.000005). There was an inverse association between AT and the number of hospital admissions due to AMI and a direct association with particulate matter with a diameter smaller than 10 μm. Conclusions. Hospital admissions for AMI followed a downward trend between 2007 and 2015. Mortality associated with admissions due to this diagnosis has decreased. Predictive factors for this disease were AT and particulate matter with a diameter smaller than 10 μm.","tags":["Acute myocardial infarction","Apparent temperature","Air pollutants","Particulate matter"],"title":"Role of Apparent Temperature and Air Pollutants in Hospital Admissions for Acute Myocardial Infarction in the North of Spain","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D Royé","A Figueiras","M Taracido-Trunk"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1522540800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1522540800,"objectID":"8c48be3d65e4bed0ce4fe5203eb06bb0","permalink":"/en/publication/pharma_coru%C3%B1a_2018/","publishdate":"2018-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/pharma_coru%C3%B1a_2018/","section":"publication","summary":"The consumption of medication, especially over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, can reflect environmental exposure with a lesser degree of severity in terms of morbidity. The non-linear effects of maximum and minimum apparent temperature on respiratory drug sales in A Coruña from 2006 to 2010 were examined using a distributed lag non-linear model. In particular, low apparent temperatures proved to be associated with increased sales of respiratory drugs. The strongest consistent risk estimates were found for minimum apparent temperatures in respiratory drug sales with an increase of 33.4% (95% CI: 12.5-58.0%) when the temperature changed from 2.8 ºC to −1.4 ºC. These findings may serve to guide the planning of public health interventions in order to predict and manage the health effects of exposure to the thermal environment for lower degrees of morbidity. More precisely, significant increases in the use of measured OTC medication could be used to identify and anticipate influenza outbreaks due to a more sensitive degree of the data source.","tags":["drug sales","pharmacoepidemiology","respiratory cause","short‐term effects","Spain","thermal environment"],"title":"Short-term effects of heat and cold on respiratory drug use.

The analysis conducted employed three main methods: the circulation weather types developed by Jenkinson \u0026 Collison, the fit of a generalized additive model for geographic variables and the use of a concentration index for the ratio of lightning strikes and thunderstorm days. The main activity in the summer months can be attributed to situations with eastern or anticyclonic flow due to convection by insolation. In winter, lightning proves to have a frontal origin and is mainly associated with western or cyclonic flow situations which occur with advections of air masses of maritime origin. The largest number of CG discharges occurs under eastern flow and their hybrids with anticyclonic situations. Thunderstorms with greater CG lightning activity, highlighted by a higher Concentration Index, are located in areas with a higher density of lightning strikes, above all in mountainous areas away from the sea. The modeling of lightning density with geographic variables shows the positive influence of altitude and, particularly, distance to the sea, with nonlinear relationships due to the complex orography of the region. Likewise, areas with convex topography receive more lightning strikes than concave ones, a relation which has been demonstrated for the first time from a Generalized Additive Model (GAM).","tags":["thunderstorm","Iberian Peninsula","Concentration Index","weather types","Convexity Index","Generalized Additive Model","cloud-to-ground lightning"],"title":"Spatial–temporal patterns of cloud-to-ground lightning over the northwest Iberian Peninsula during the period 2010–2015","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D Royé"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1501545600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1501545600,"objectID":"735acb4c3b633c5b3cfad91a943dfb61","permalink":"/en/publication/hotnights_bcn_2017/","publishdate":"2017-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/hotnights_bcn_2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Heat-related effects on mortality have been widely analyzed using maximum and minimum temperatures as exposure variables. Nevertheless, the main focus is usually on the former with the minimum temperature being limited in use as far as human health effects are concerned. Therefore, new thermal indices were used in this research to describe the duration of night hours with air temperatures higher than the 95% percentile of the minimum temperature (Hot Night hours) and intensity as the summation of these air temperatures in degrees (Hot Night degrees). An exposure-response relationship between mortality due to natural, respiratory and cardiovascular causes and summer night temperatures was assessed using data from the Barcelona region between 2003 and 2013. The non-linear relationship between the exposure and response variables was modeled using a distributed lag non-linear model. The estimated associations for both exposure variables and mortality shows a relationship with high and medium values that persist significantly up to a lag of 1–2 days. In mortality due to natural causes an increase of 1.1% per 10% (CI95% 0.6–1.5) for Hot Night hours and 5.8% per each 10º (CI95% 3.5–8.2%) for Hot Night degrees is observed. The effects of Hot Night hours reach their maximum with 100% and leads to an increase by 9.2% (CI95% 5.3–13.1%). The hourly description of night heat effects reduced to a single indicator in duration and intensity is a new approach and shows a different perspective and significant heat-related effects on human health.","tags":["heat","mortality","tropical night","hot night","effects","human health","climate change"],"title":"The effects of hot nights on mortality in Barcelona, Spain","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D Royé","J Martin-Vide"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1496275200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1496275200,"objectID":"83752c0287cd3c7c14fd70c98985fa6b","permalink":"/en/publication/usa_ci_2017/","publishdate":"2017-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/usa_ci_2017/","section":"publication","summary":"The contiguous US exhibits a wide variety of precipitation regimes, first, because of the wide range of latitudes and altitudes. The physiographic units with a basic meridional configuration contribute to the differentiation between east and west in the country while generating some large interior continental spaces. The frequency distribution of daily precipitation amounts almost anywhere conforms to a negative exponential distribution, reflecting the fact that there are many small daily totals and few large ones. Positive exponential curves, which plot the cumulative percentages of days with precipitation against the cumulative percentage of the rainfall amounts that they contribute, can be evaluated through the Concentration Index. The Concentration Index has been applied to the contiguous United States using a gridded climate dataset of daily precipitation data, at a resolution of 0.25°, provided by CPC/NOAA/OAR/Earth System Research Laboratory, for the period between 1956 and 2006. At the same time, other rainfall indices and variables such as the annual coefficient of variation, seasonal rainfall regimes and the probabilities of a day with precipitation have been presented with a view to explaining spatial CI patterns. The spatial distribution of the CI in the contiguous United States is geographically consistent, reflecting the principal physiographic and climatic units of the country. Likewise, linear correlations have been established between the CI and geographical factors such as latitude, longitude and altitude. In the latter case the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) between this factor and the CI is −0.51 (p-value ","tags":["Concentration Index","Contiguous United States","daily precipitation","precipitation indices","spatial–temporal patterns"],"title":"Concentration of Daily Precipitation in the Contiguous United States","type":"publication"},{"authors":["P Fdez-Arroyabe","D Royé"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"389371f80a93c479ccb639ee58c2c7bf","permalink":"/en/publication/chapter_springer_2017/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/chapter_springer_2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Co-creation of scientific knowledge based on new technologies and big data sources is one of the main challenges for the digital society in the XXI century.

This study looked specifically at the connections in winter between respiratory diseases and types of atmospheric weather conditions (Circulation Weather Types, CWT) in Galicia, a region in the north-western corner of the Iberian Peninsula. To do this, the study used hospital admission data associated with these pathologies as well as an automatic classification of weather types. The main result obtained was that weather types giving rise to an increase in admissions due to these diseases are those associated with cold, dry weather, such as those in the east and south-east, or anticyclonic types. A second peak was associated with humid, hotter weather, generally linked to south-west weather types. In the future, this result may help to forecast the increase in respiratory pathologies in the region some days in advance.","tags":["weather type","respiratory diseases","hospital admissions","human health","Spain"],"title":"Winter circulation weather types and hospital admissions for respiratory diseases in Galicia, Spain","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D Royé","A Ezpeleta-Martí"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1448928000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1448928000,"objectID":"48e40344ca1e4f7a2ab2a6c4510aa260","permalink":"/en/publication/hotnights_age_2015/","publishdate":"2015-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/hotnights_age_2015/","section":"publication","summary":"Analysis of tropical nights on the Atlantic coast of the Iberian peninsula.

There is a significant increase in the frequency of tropical nights and warm nights on the Atlantic coast, from the north of Galicia to the south of Portugal. The lower latitude and proximity to the coastline are associated with greater persistence of heat and thermal stress during these nights. In inland areas the persistence is less.
