      <description>This year, the so-called warming stripes, which were created by the scientist Ed Hawkins of the University of Reading, became very famous all over the world. These graphs represent and communicate climate change in a very illustrative and effective way.

      <description>Welcome to my blog! I am Dominic Royé, researcher and lecturer of physical geography at the University of Santiago de Compostela. One of my passions is R programming to visualize and analyze any type of data. Hence, my idea of this blog has its origin in my datavis publications I have been cooking in the last year on Twitter on different topics describing the world. In addition, I would like to take advantage of the blog and publish short introductions and explanation on data visualization, management and manipulation in R.</description>
